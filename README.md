# BAFG Converter
## Motivation 
The goal of this toy project was to convert monthly discharge data of certain hydrological stations from a format in which they were downloaded from the website of BAFG = Bundesanstalt für Gewässerkunde (Koblenz, Germany), to pandas dataframes (to be able to extract information and manipulate the data in a civilized way).

## Scope
The 28 hydrological stations under consideration are geographically within the Ferghana Valley in Central Asia (selected not randomly, but because of an earlier acqaintance).
